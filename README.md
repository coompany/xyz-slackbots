###### Slackbots for XYZ

This repo contains the source code for two types of bots for Slack coded during
[XYZ](http://lascuolaopensource.xyz/XYZ/) in July 2016 to aid planning and cooperation.
The same bot is developed both in **Haskell** and **Scala** and source code is in their
respective directories.

Bots implemented:
- *CronoBot*: replies to a single command by fetching events from a Google Sheets form;
- *PirateBot*: replies to a single command with a randomly generated pirate name.

Missing bots (sources gone lost):
- *NunziaBot*: fetches catering's menu of the day from a Google Sheet (with swag).
